The `SelectLocalBody` component enables users to select local bodies within a specific district. It offers options to customize the language and supports both English and Nepali languages. A valid district string is required as a prop to provide accurate results.


### 1. Select Local Body in English

```jsx
<SelectLocalBody
  lang="en"
  district="Kathmandu"
  placeholder="Select a local body in Kathmandu"
/>
```

### 2. Select Local Body in Nepali

```jsx
<SelectLocalBody
  lang="np"
  district="Lalitpur"
  placeholder="नगरपालिका छनोट गर्नुहोस्"
/>
```

## Notes

- The `SelectLocalBody` component depends on the \`BaseSelect\` component and the \`react-select\` library for its functionality.
- Ensure to provide a valid district string as the \`district\` prop for accurate results.
